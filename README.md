#First version - WIP
##TODO
* Create a new project with generic accounting interfaces.
* Implement these interfaces in java-winbooks.
* Implement them here. 
* Replace all java-winbooks usage by the generic one.
* Write tests that prove that both projects (this and java-winbooks) give similar results on converted accounting data.
